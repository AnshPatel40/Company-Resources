## 🔍 What is Software Testing?

> **Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to identify bugs or issues and ensure the product meets the expected quality standards. 🐞✅

### ⚙️ Key Points:
- Identifies **errors**, **gaps**, or **missing requirements**.
- Ensures product behaves as expected under various scenarios.
- Critical for delivering **reliable**, **stable**, and **high-performing** software.

---

## 🧠 Objectives of Software Testing

- ✅ Ensure the software works as intended.
- 🧱 Detect and fix bugs before release.
- 📉 Minimize failure risk post-deployment.
- 🏗 Improve software robustness and performance.

---

## 🧪 Types of Software Testing

### 🔸 Based on Execution:
- **Manual Testing** 🧑‍💻 – Test cases executed by a human tester.
- **Automation Testing** 🤖 – Test cases executed by automation tools like Selenium, QTP.

### 🔸 Based on Knowledge of System:
- **Black Box Testing** ⚫ – No knowledge of internal code, focus on input/output.
- **White Box Testing** ⚪ – Full visibility into code and logic.
- **Gray Box Testing** ⚫⚪ – Partial knowledge, mix of both techniques.

## 🧰 Software Testing Techniques

- 🔍 **Equivalence Partitioning**
- 🧪 **Boundary Value Analysis**
- 🧠 **Decision Table Testing**
- 💭 **State Transition Testing**
- 🔄 **Error Guessing**

These techniques help testers design effective test cases with minimal effort and high coverage.

---

## 🧾 Levels of Testing

1. 🧱 **Unit Testing** – Testing individual units/modules.
2. 🧩 **Integration Testing** – Testing interfaces between modules.
3. 🧮 **System Testing** – Testing the complete application.
4. 🔁 **Acceptance Testing** – Verifying software readiness from a user's point of view.

---

## 🧬 Test Artifacts

- 📝 **Test Plan** – Scope, approach, resources, and schedule.
- 🧾 **Test Case** – Conditions to check if a feature works.
- 🧪 **Test Script** – Set of instructions to validate a test case.
- 📋 **Bug Report** – Documenting defects for fixing.
