## 🌐 What is Software Development?

> **Software Development** is the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software. It involves a set of activities that result in software products being delivered to end-users. 💾

👨‍💻 It includes:
- Writing & maintaining source code
- Designing software architecture
- Testing & debugging
- Deployment & support

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Software Development

- 🏗 Build efficient and scalable software
- 💰 Deliver business value with tech
- 🚀 Improve user productivity
- 🔒 Ensure reliability and security
- 🔁 Simplify maintenance and upgrades

---

## 🧩 Phases of Software Development

1. **Requirement Gathering** 📋  
   Understanding the needs of stakeholders.

2. **Design** 🧠  
   High-level & low-level architectural planning.

3. **Implementation** 💻  
   Actual coding and development phase.

4. **Testing** 🧪  
   Ensuring the product is defect-free.

5. **Deployment** 🚢  
   Delivering the software to users.

6. **Maintenance** 🔧  
   Regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements.
